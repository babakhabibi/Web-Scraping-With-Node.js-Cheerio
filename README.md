Definition of the project:  Scraping HuffingtonPost articles which is related to Italy and save it to an Excel .csv file. For preventing duplicate syntax I will just grab the title and thumbnail of the news.

Letâ€™s start!

I assume you already know what is NodeJS and you have installed it on your computer.

After downloading the files you will understand we should use 2 libraries:
First <a href="https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio">Cheerio</a> And the other one is <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/request">Request</a>.

After installing you can check the result with typing <code>node scrape</code>

Feel free to improve this code :)
